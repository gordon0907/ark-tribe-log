# ark-tribe-log

A Flask HTTP server for displaying your ARK: Survival Evolved tribe log. Designed specifically for deployment on
Synology DSM using the "Containerized Script Language Website" feature with alias-based web portals.

## Preparation

Update the `TRIBE_FILE_PATH` in `server.py` to match the Tribe ID of the tribe you want to host.

## Installation

This guide demonstrates how to host the website using DSM's "Containerized Script Language Website" feature.  
Reference: [Synology Help - Web Service](https://kb.synology.com/en-us/DSM/help/WebStation/application_webserv_webservice?version=7)

> Note: Some terminology may differ from the official English-language DSM, as this guide is based on a translated
> (non-English native) DSM interface.

### 1. Download and Place Files

Download this repository and extract it. Copy `server.py` to a suitable DSM directory. Optionally, you can also copy
`icon.png` to the same directory to enable the page favicon.  
Example path:  
`/volume1/web_packages/docker/ark-tribe-log`

> It's recommended to use directories under `web` or `web_packages`, as they are granted read access by default to the
`http` user group.

### 2. Create a Python Web Service

  ```
